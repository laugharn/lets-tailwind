## What is Tailwind?

https://tailwindcss.com

---

- A less opinionated CSS framework
- Atomic classes with variants
- Configuration driven

---

### A less opinionated CSS framework

- Powered by PostCSS, outputs CSS
- Handles normalization, browser quirks, etc.
- Support for plugins
- Does not have built in components like buttons, etc.

---

### Atomic classes

- Every class does one thing
- Variants are handled with a colon delineation (hover:, md:, etc.)
- Coontrolled by your Tailwind configuration

---

### Configuration driven

- Generate classes from a tailwind.config.js object (or use sensible defaults)
- Extendable with plugins
- Configuration object is available in JS

**Caveat:** Since classes are configuration driven, if you have a designer, using Tailwind will require buy-in. You can adjust your scale as necessary, but _should_ you?

## Why Not ____?

- JavaScript (Styled Components)
- Popular preprocessor (LESS/SASS/Stylus)
- Popular framework (Bootstrap/Foundation/Material)
- Popular pattern (BEM/OOCSS)

---

### JavaScript (Styled Components)

- Not as performant as good ol' CSS
- Tricky with SSR
- Difficult to extricate from your codebase
- Doesn't handle variants well

---

### Popular preprocessor (LESS/SASS/Stylus)

- God has abandoned `yarn add node-sass --dev`
- What's the right way to handle dependencies
- You have nesting and variables and features but then what?

---

### Popular framework (Bootstrap/Foundation/Material)

- You can't commit to using the framework as intended, and your stakeholders definitely can't
- You're not fooling anyone when you try to dress it up

---

### Popular pattern (BEM/OOCSS)

- Fails in the face of edge cases. What happens when a stakeholder wants to reuse .card but just this one time wants an extra 10px of padding?
- Requires the engineer to name stuff
- You'll inevitably break the pattern, and doing these patterns correctly is difficult to enforce and offers minimal returns
